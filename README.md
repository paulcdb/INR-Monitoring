# INR-Monitoring

Slowly working on cleaning up the code for the PHP site. 

## Getting Started

You need Apache, MySQL and PHP and phpgraphlib for the graphs. Once this are setup you can just copy the files to the web server folder. run the schema.sql to create the database and change the details in both dbconnect.php as well as the graphlib.php 

I haven't yet got around to running the graphs from the same dbconnect.php file.

### Prerequisites

## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to anyone whose code was used
* Elliott Brueggeman for his amazing graphing libary
* https://www.reddit.com/user/keepcalm2 for helping me with some MySQL coding. Hopefully I get time to update the wemos code so it's more secure instead if having to pull from a webpage.
